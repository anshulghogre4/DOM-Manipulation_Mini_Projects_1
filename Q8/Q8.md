## Code

```javascript
let div = document.querySelector("#SIvCob");
let anch = div.querySelectorAll("a");

for (let i = anch.length - 1; i >= 0; i = i - 2) {
  anch[i].remove();
}
```

## Take a Note

    Sometimes for traditional for loop doesn't work so you need to run it reverse to get the desire output.
